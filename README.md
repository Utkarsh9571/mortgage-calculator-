## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

This is the very first calculator of any kind made by me, also i think its the only one project which accepts inputs from user to display somewhere or do something with it, it was a long due project, this type of projects where you get user inputs and interactions and you have to display them or use that input to do something, i was waiting for so long (well a month) to do that. 

I got learned that there maybe not a in-built function for calculations so we have to convert actual formula to calculate something into javascript and use, it that the only new thing this challenge had for me.

Form validation with react is so fun to do, allowing decimal values as input are some minor thing that got introduced to me, hope they stuck around in my mind. 

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
